============================================================

TEST SET METRICS:
  IoU:  0.922856 ± 0.084366
  Dice: 0.957477 ± 0.054960
  Samples: 63

COMPARISON WITH HYPOTHESIS 1:
  H1 Dice: 0.0370
  H2 Dice: 0.9575
  Improvement: 2487.8%

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN H2:
  1. Filled masks (vs boundary-only)
  2. Focal + Dice loss (vs BCE + Dice)
  3. Heavy augmentation (6 types)
  4. Post-processing with morphology
  5. Weight decay regularization

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR H3:
  - Pre-trained encoder (ResNet34/EfficientNet)
