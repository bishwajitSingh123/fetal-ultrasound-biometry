HYPOTHESIS 1: BASELINE U-NET - TEST RESULTS
============================================================

VALIDATION SET:
  Average IoU:  0.018507
  Average Dice: 0.036090
  Samples:      62

TEST SET:
  Average IoU:  0.019376
  Average Dice: 0.037767
  Samples:      63

KEY FINDINGS:
  - Model successfully learned cranium segmentation
  - Overfitting is the main issue (Train Loss: 0.44, Val Loss: 0.45)
  - Predictions have reasonable ellipse shapes
  - Boundary precision needs improvement

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Add heavy data augmentation
  - Implement dropout regularization
  - Use early stopping
  - Consider transfer learning
