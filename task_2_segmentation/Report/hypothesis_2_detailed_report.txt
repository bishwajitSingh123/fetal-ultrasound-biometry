HYPOTHESIS 2: DETAILED EVALUATION REPORT
================================================================================

MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
  - Base: U-Net (7.8M parameters)
  - Encoder: 4 downsampling blocks (64→128→256→512)
  - Decoder: 4 upsampling blocks with skip connections
  - Output: Single channel sigmoid (256x256)

TRAINING CONFIGURATION:
  - Loss: Focal (0.3) + Dice (0.7)
  - Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
  - Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=5, factor=0.5)
  - Early Stopping: patience=8
  - Batch Size: 8
  - Epochs: 50 (trained for 50)

DATA PREPROCESSING:
  ✓ CLAHE contrast enhancement (clipLimit=2.0)
  ✓ Filled masks (25-28% coverage)
  ✓ Resize to 256x256
  ✓ Normalization to [0,1]

DATA AUGMENTATION (Training Only):
  ✓ Horizontal flip (50%)
  ✓ Vertical flip (50%)
  ✓ Rotation ±15° (50%)
  ✓ Brightness ±20% (30%)
  ✓ Gaussian noise σ=5 (20%)
  ✓ Zoom 0.9-1.1 (20%)

TRAINING RESULTS:
  - Best Validation Loss: 0.0350 (epoch 44)
  - Final Train Loss: 0.0356
  - Final Val Loss: 0.0443
  - Training Time: 24.0 minutes

TEST SET PERFORMANCE:
  - Average Dice: 0.9575 ± 0.0550
  - Average IoU:  0.9229 ± 0.0844
  - Test Samples: 63

POST-PROCESSING:
  ✓ Threshold at 0.5
  ✓ Keep largest connected component
  ✓ Morphological closing (5x5 kernel)

ELLIPSE FITTING:
  ✓ cv2.fitEllipse on contours
  ✓ Major axis endpoints = biometry points

KEY IMPROVEMENTS OVER H1:
  1. Filled masks (+2488% Dice improvement!)
  2. Focal loss (better for imbalance)
  3. Heavy augmentation (prevents overfitting)
  4. Weight decay regularization

CONCLUSION:
  ✅ EXCELLENT performance (Dice=0.958)
  ✅ Recommended for deployment
  ✅ Demonstrates critical importance of data quality
